# CAD-Projects
This is all my cad projects I created few years back.

I know all these files are not named properly but if you are starting with CAD or want to start with CAD than all these files will help.
I used Design Spark to make all these cause my computer at that time couldn't use heavy CAD software like fusion 360 or AutoCAD.
Here's a link to download the software. 🔗

Hope you have fun learning. 👍
